It looks like you're interested in creating a resume using a resume builder website. There are several online platforms that offer tools to help you create professional resumes. While I can't provide real-time information about the latest websites available, I can offer you a general outline of how to use such a platform:

Choose a Platform: Research and select a reputable resume builder website. Some popular options as of my last knowledge update in September 2021 were:

Canva: Offers a wide range of templates for various industries.
Zety: Provides customizable templates and content suggestions.
ResumeGenius: Offers a step-by-step resume-building process.
Sign Up or Log In: Create an account on the chosen website if required. Some platforms offer basic features for free, while others might have premium options for more advanced features.

Select a Template: Browse through the available resume templates and choose one that suits your style and industry. These templates often have predefined sections and layouts for your convenience.

Input Your Information:

Personal Information: Input your name, contact details, and professional profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
Summary or Objective: Write a brief summary or objective that highlights your career goals and key skills.
Work Experience: Input your work history, including company names, job titles, dates, and job descriptions.
Education: Enter your educational background, including institutions, degrees, and graduation dates.
Skills: List your relevant skills, such as technical skills, languages, certifications, etc.
Projects or Achievements: Include any noteworthy projects, achievements, or awards.
References: You can optionally include references or state that they are available upon request.
Customize Content: Tailor the content of each section to showcase your experiences and skills that are most relevant to the job you're applying for. Use action verbs and quantifiable achievements where possible.

Formatting and Design:

Font and Typography: Choose a readable font and ensure consistent typography throughout the resume.
Colors: Stick to a professional color scheme that matches the template or complements your industry.
Layout: Ensure a clean and organized layout that's easy to read. Pay attention to spacing and alignment.
Proofread: Thoroughly review your resume for spelling, grammar, and formatting errors. Consider asking a friend or colleague to review it as well.

Download and Save: Once you're satisfied with your resume, download it in a suitable format (PDF is often recommended for compatibility). Save a copy for yourself and label it appropriately.

Update as Needed: Remember to update your resume regularly to reflect your latest experiences, skills, and achievements.

Always remember that the quality of the content matters more than the design, so focus on presenting your skills and experiences in the best light possible.
